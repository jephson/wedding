        <h1>Gifts</h1>
        <p>
          As we are both grown ups, and are both working, we don’t
          feel the need for any large wedding gifts. (Honestly we have
          all the ‘stuff’ we need.) However, if you would like to
          contribute a small donation to Medcins sans frontiers we
          have set up a just giving page
          (www.justgiving.com/fundraising/AlexandSimonWed). Please
          don’t feel obliged to give anything though; we would far
          rather that you come and enjoyed yourself.
